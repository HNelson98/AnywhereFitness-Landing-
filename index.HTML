        <h2>It's Time</h2>
        <p> These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere - a park, an unfinished basement or a garage - not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing. While you could use several mobile apps to accomplish this, AnywhereFitness is the all-in-one solution to meet your “on-location” fitness class needs.</p>
